# Titanic Survivors Prediction

Welcome to the Titanic Survivors Prediction project! This project aims to predict the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. By analyzing historical data and applying machine learning algorithms, we can gain insights into the factors that influenced survival and build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers onboard the Titanic, including their attributes and whether they survived or not. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the predictive models.

## Methodology

1. Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand its structure, feature distribution, missing values, and correlations between variables. This step helps us gain insights into the data and identify patterns.

2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations. Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is suitable for training machine learning models.

3. Feature Engineering: New features are created based on domain knowledge and insights from the dataset to enhance the predictive power of the models. This step involves extracting meaningful information from the available features or combining them to create new ones.

4. Model Selection: Various classification models are considered, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines. The models are evaluated based on their performance and ability to accurately predict passenger survival.

5. Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The selected models are trained using the training data, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (survival).

6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the performance and effectiveness of the models in predicting passenger survival.

7. Model Fine-tuning: Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or random search, are applied to optimize the models' hyperparameters. This step further improves the models' performance by finding the best combination of parameters.

4. Open the `Titanic Survivours Prediction.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions.

## Results

The project provides predictions on the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic. By analyzing the selected models' performance and accuracy, we gain insights into the factors that influenced survival and develop a reliable prediction model.

## Future Enhancements

- Feature Importance: Analyzing the importance of different features in predicting survival to understand which factors had the most significant impact.
- Ensemble Methods: Exploring ensemble methods, such as stacking or boosting, to further improve prediction accuracy.
- Deployment: Deploying the trained model as a web application or API to provide real-time predictions or integrate it into other systems.
